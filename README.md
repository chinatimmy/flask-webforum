# Flask Web Forum in Python3!
## TxT Board

Kek or Cringe?? 

You decide.

*FWF* is powered by Python and built on a Sqlite database.  It uses  *POST requests* for instant interactions. *FWF* has many modern features out of the box such as XSS security integration and Text based discussions. *FWF* keeps a light foot print and is compatible with older browsers.

Demo @ https://goblinnet.xyz



To start the server, run these commands!

    touch data.sqlite
    export FLASK_APP=forum.py
    flask run
