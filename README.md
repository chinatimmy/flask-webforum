# Flask Web Forum!
## TxT Board

Kek or Cringe?? 

You decide.

*FWF* is powered by Python and built on a Sqlite database.  It uses  *POST requests* for instant interactions. *FWF* has many modern features out of the box such as XSS security integration and Text based discussions. *FWF* keeps a light foot print and is compatible with older browsers.
